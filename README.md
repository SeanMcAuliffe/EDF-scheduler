# EDF-scheduler
Earliest Deadline First scheduler implemented on top of FreeRTOS for the STM32

This scheduler was implemented as part of a Real Time Systems course. The objective of this project was to design a custom Deadline-Driven Scheduler to dynamically manage
tasks with hard deadlines. Earlist Deadline First scheduling is used to maximum processor utilization.

This project is intended to be compiled in Atollic for the STM32 F4 discovery board.
